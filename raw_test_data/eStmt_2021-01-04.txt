IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT
CALCULATION OF BALANCES SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE
Average Daily Balance Method (including new Purchases): We calculate
separate Balances Subject to an Interest Rate for Purchases and for each
Introductory or Promotional Offer balance consisting of Purchases. We do this
by: (1) calculating a daily balance for each day in the billing cycle; (2) adding all
the daily balances together; and (3) dividing the sum of the daily balances by
the number of days in the billing cycle.
To calculate the daily balance for each day in this statement2s billing cycle, we:
(1) take the beginning balance; (2) add an amount equal to the applicable Daily
Periodic Rate multiplied by the previous day2s daily balance; (3) add new
Purchases, new Account Fees, and new Transaction Fees; and (4) subtract
applicable payments and credits. If any daily balance is less than zero we treat
it as zero.
Average Balance Method (including new Balance Transfers and new Cash
Advances): We calculate separate Balances Subject to an Interest Rate for
Balance Transfers, Cash Advances, and for each Introductory or Promotional
Offer balance consisting of Balance Transfers or Cash Advances. We do this by:
(1) calculating a daily balance for each day in this statement2s billing cycle; (2)
calculating a daily balance for each day prior to this statement2s billing cycle
that had a 3Pre-Cycle balance4 - a Pre-Cycle balance is a Balance Transfer or a
Cash Advance with a transaction date prior to this statement2s billing cycle but
with a posting date within this statement2s billing cycle; (3) adding all the daily
balances together; and (4) dividing the sum of the daily balances by the number
of days in this statement2s billing cycle.
To calculate the daily balance for each day in this statement2s billing cycle, we:
(1) take the beginning balance; (2) add an amount equal to the applicable Daily
Periodic Rate multiplied by the previous day2s daily balance; (3) add new
Balance Transfers, new Cash Advances and Transaction Fees; and (4) subtract
applicable payments and credits. If any daily balance is less than zero we treat
it as zero.
To calculate a daily balance for each day prior to this statement2s billing cycle
that had a Pre-Cycle balance: (1) we take the beginning balance attributable
solely to Pre-Cycle balance (which will be zero on the transaction date of the
first Pre-Cycle balance); (2) add an amount equal to the applicable Daily
Periodic Rate multiplied by the previous day2s daily balance; (3) and add only
the applicable Pre-Cycle balances and their related Transaction Fees. We
exclude from this calculation all transactions posted in previous billing cycles.
For the complete terms and conditions of your account, consult your Credit
Card Agreement. This account is issued and administered by Bank of America.
Bank of America is a registered trademark of Bank of America Corporation.
PAYING INTEREST - We will not charge interest on Purchases on the next
statement if you pay the New Balance Total in full by the Payment Due Date,
and you had paid in full by the previous Payment Due Date. We will begin
charging interest on Balance Transfers and Cash Advances on the transaction
date.
TOTAL INTEREST CHARGE COMPUTATION - Interest Charges accrue and
are compounded on a daily basis. To determine the Interest Charges, we
multiply each Balance Subject to Interest Rate by its applicable Daily Periodic
Rate and that result is multiplied by the number of days in the billing cycle. To
determine the total Interest Charge for the billing cycle, we add the Periodic
Rate Interest Charges together. A Daily Periodic Rate is calculated by dividing
an Annual Percentage Rate by 365.
HOW WE ALLOCATE YOUR PAYMENTS - Payments are allocated to
posted balances. If your account has balances with different APRs, we will
allocate the amount of your payment equal to the Total Minimum Payment Due
to the lowest APR balances first (including transactions made after this
statement). Payment amounts in excess of your Total Minimum Payment Due
will be applied to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower APRs.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PAYMENTS BY PHONE - When
using the optional Pay-by-Phone service, you authorize us to initiate an
electronic payment from your account at the financial institution you designate.
You must authorize the amount and timing of each payment. For your
protection, we will ask for security information. A fee may apply for expedited
service. To cancel, call us before the scheduled payment date. Same-day
payments cannot be edited or canceled.
YOUR CREDIT LINES - The Total Credit Line is the amount of credit
available for the account; however, only a portion of that is available for Bank
Cash Advances. The Cash Credit Line is that amount you have available for
Bank Cash Advances. Generally, Bank Cash Advances consist of ATM Cash
Advances, Over the Counter (OTC) Cash Advances, Same-Day Online Cash
Advances, Overdraft Protection Cash Advances, Cash Equivalents, and
applicable transaction fees.
MISCELLANEOUS - Promotional Rate End Date: This date is based on a
future statement closing date. If you change your payment due date, this date
could change. The New Balance Total which appears on this statement is not a
payoff amount and may be subject to additional interest charges when you pay
in full after your statement closing date. Please contact the customer service
number located on the front of this statement for a pay-off amount. Virtual
cards are the digital form of your eligible physical credit cards stored within a
digital wallet.

PAYMENTS - We credit mailed payments as of the date received, if the payment is: (1) received by 5 p.m. local time at the address shown on the remittance portion of your
monthly statement; (2) paid with a check drawn in U.S. dollars on a U.S. financial institution or a U.S. dollar money order; and (3) sent in the return envelope with only the remittance
portion of your statement accompanying it. Payments received by mail after 5 p.m. local time at the remittance address on any day including the Payment Due Date, but that otherwise
meet the above requirements, will be credited as of the next day. Payments made online or by phone will be credited as of the date of receipt if made by 5 p.m. Central. Credit for any
other payments may be delayed up to five days. Cash payments made with our tellers will only be accepted with a valid identification (ID).
No payment shall operate as an accord and satisfaction without the prior written approval of one of our Senior Officers.
We process most payment checks electronically by using the information found on your check. Each check authorizes us to create a one-time electronic funds transfer (or process it as a
check or paper draft). Funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same day we receive your payment. Checks are not returned to you.
If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings or checking account with us, you can stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop
payment, your letter must reach us at least three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur.
